This error occurs when you try to access a state variable before it has been initialized.  This commonly happens when rendering a component before the state has had a chance to update. For example, if you have a state variable `userName` that's updated asynchronously (e.g., fetching data from an API), and you try to render it directly in the component's JSX before the API call resolves, you'll encounter this issue.  Another common scenario is if you're trying to use a state variable within a component before the component's `useEffect` hook has completed its first execution.
